## Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection (HIV)

Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection (HIV) dataset contains two views. One of which is collected from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The other is collected from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Both includes 35 samples from patients (positive) and 35 healthy controls (negative). Each graph contains 90 nodes (ROIs) and the edge weights corresponding to the adjacency matrix are calculated as the correlations between brain regions.

## Bipolar Disorder (BP)

Bipolar Disorder (BP) dataset also contains two views: fMRI and DTI. It consists of 52 bipolar subjects and 45 healthy controls with matched age and gender. It stimulates 82 brain regions, according to Freesurfer-generated cortical/subcortical gray matter regions. Functional brain networks are derived using pairwise BOLD signal correlations.
